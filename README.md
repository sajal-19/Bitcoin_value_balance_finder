# Bitcoin_value_balance_finder
In this repo there is a python code by which you can find the value and balance of bitcoin

In the code, we have the task of finding out the Balance and Value in Usd of Bitcoin.

Task 1: I write the code by giving "3" addresses of Bitcoin.(Use as many you want)  
Task 2: I fetch the data using Blockchain.info API  
Task 3: Python code. So the code follows as-    
           3.1 Importing the Libraries     
           3.2 Putting API key, addresses, and the currency     
           3.3 Fetching current Bitcoin price in USD from Blockchain.info API     
           3.4 Creating a new workbook with the current timestamp as the title      
           3.5 Adding a header to the sheet as - Address, Balance, Value     
           3.6 Fetching balances of each address and print to the console and sheet     
           3.7 Saving the workbook to a new file     

That is all that I have done in the task assigned.
